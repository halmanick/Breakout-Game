# **Project Proposal - Breakout**

**Objective of BreakoutGame:**

- A layer of bricks cover the the top section of the screen, with the goal of destroying them all.
- A ball moves straight around the screen, bouncing off the top and two sides of the screen.
- Player has a horizontally movable paddle to bounce the ball upward, keeping it in play.
- When a brick is hit, the ball bounces back and the brick is destroyed.
- The player loses a turn when the ball touches the bottom of the screen.

**Background:**

I think that this would be a fun, yet manageable game to create. I am very interested in re-creating this game, as I
loved playing it as a kid. I think that working on a game, specifically this one, will be motivating to complete since
it is a fun concept that pushes me to want to add my own touch on it, so I can work towards something that brings me 
enjoyment. 

**Rough Timeline:**

1. Week 1 - Set up design of game, and start to add basic functionality such creating map, moving player and ball, etc.
2. Week 2 - Polish up features such as scoring, amount of lives, what happens when you lose, and polish up overall functionality.
   and physics of game.
3. Week 3 - Add more cool graphics, implement more features such as adding multiple balls, adding different levels with
   different speeds, add ability to choose difficulty from start, and cover all edge cases, etc.
   
**Extra Stretch Goals:**

If I were to finish early, I would want to add as many features as I can, as listed in Week 3. I would also want to add 
very cool graphics, maybe increasing the speed manually, shrinking platform for higher difficulty as well as increasing 
speed, adding level system and high score, adding more balls, etc. Just any other possible feature that will allow me to
put my own touch on it, so as many of the features I listed in week 3 and more. As well as focus on graphics to make game
look appealing, adding ray tracing. If I completely have way more time than anticipated, try to possibly make a 3D version
(Definitely a stretch, but would look awesome!)
